AIM : 
perform data analysis in R and visualize the post analysis results using R graphic capabilites.

DESCRIPTION Creating a graph using post data analysis and demonstrate how to create basic graph types including density plots, dat plots, bar charts exc.

Cmd: Counts <- table (Arthritis & improved)

Sun: table (....,exclude = if(useNA = = "no ) )

DESCRIPTION Table uses the Cross-Chissifying factors to build a Contigency table of the factor levels Counts at Fach Combination of factor levels

barplot (counts, main _ " Grouped Bar plot", Xlab="Treatment",ylab="Frequency",... besid= TRUE)

SYNTAX barplot (height, ...)

DESCRIPTION

Create a bar plot with vertical or horizontal bars

COMMAND
Means <- aggregate (States$ illiteracy by = list (State(region) FUN - mean) 

SYNTAX
aggregate (x,...)

DESCRIPTION Splits the data into Subsets, Computer Summary Statistics for each and returns the result in a Convenient form

COMMAND

Spine (Counts, main = " Spinogram Example")

Spine (x,..)

SYNTAX

DESCRIPTION

Spine puts are a special case of mosaic plots, and can be seen as a Generalization of standard bar plats.spinograms are an of  Stacked bar plats extension of
histograms

COMMAND

plat (wit, mpg, main= "Basic scatterplot of Mpg vs weight" x lab = " car weight (lbs/1000)"," ylab= "Car Miles par Gallon",pch=la)

SCatterplot (data, Select = NULL, "type = [ ("Jitter" "size")

DESCRIPTION

This function produces a scatterplot Matriz

COMMAND

Scatter plot (mpg ~wtl [yl, main="scatter plat of mpg vs. weight by # cylinders" ,xlab = " weight of car (lbs/1000)' ylab = "Milles per gallon",id.method "identify", baxplots="xy")

Scatter plot (data, select = NULL, type = c("jitter"" size")

DESCRIPTION

Scatterplot fonction produces a Scatterplot Matriz
COMMAND
Scatterplot matrix(~mpg + disp+drat twt, data=mtcars, Spread=FALSE main = "scatterplot matrix via car package")

SYNTAX
Scattexplot Matrix(x,...)

DESCRIPTION

This function provides a convenient Interface to the pairs function to produce enhanced scatterplat Matriz, including unvariated displays

COMMAND

Symbols (wt, mpg, Circle=r, inches =0:30, fg="write" ,bg= "light blue" ,Xlab - ' "weight of car (lbs/1000]")

Symbols (x, y = NULL Circles, Square, rectangle, Stairs -)

DESCRIPTION:

This function draws Symbel on a plot specific aspects of the Symbols, such as relative size Can be Customized by additional parameters 
COMMAND 
corrgram (mtCars, order =TRUE, lower.panel = panel.shade, upper .panel =panel.pie ,Text.panel = pand.txt )

SYNTAX 

Corrgram (x, type=NULL, Order= FALSE_ ]

DESCRIPTION.

The Corrgram correlation nutriz function provides a graph:61 display called correlogram
